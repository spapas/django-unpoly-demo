# Unpoly demo

This is a demo of [Unpoly](https://unpoly.com), a JavaScript library for
progressive enhancement of web applications. This demo is a clone of the 
original Unpoly demo (see [https://demo.unpoly.com/](https://demo.unpoly.com/))
written in Django instead of Ruby.

The demo has been deployed on render.com and can be accessed at
[https://unpoly-demo.onrender.com/](https://unpoly-demo.onrender.com/).
